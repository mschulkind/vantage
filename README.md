Vantage renders your Markdown files the way GitHub does — locally, instantly, with live reload as you edit. Point it at one directory or several, and browse your docs in a polished web UI with file tree navigation, Mermaid diagrams, commit history, and diffs.

Built for developers who write docs alongside code — especially useful for reviewing LLM-generated Markdown output in real time.

> **Platform:** Linux. macOS is untested and unsupported. Windows is not supported.

## 📦 Installation

Vantage requires **Python 3.13+** and is installed as a CLI tool using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

```bash
# Install from source
git clone https://github.com/mschulkind/vantage.git
cd vantage

# Build and install (includes the frontend)
just install
```

This makes the `vantage` command available in your PATH (typically `~/.local/bin/vantage`).

### Prerequisites

| Tool                               | Purpose                                 |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)   | Python package manager                  |
| [Node.js 22+](https://nodejs.org/) | Building the frontend                   |
| [just](https://just.systems/)      | Command runner (optional, for building) |

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Single Directory

Point Vantage at any directory containing Markdown files:

```bash
vantage serve ~/Documents/notes
```

Open **http://localhost:8000** in your browser.

### Multiple Directories (Daemon Mode)

To serve several directories at once, create a config and run the daemon:

```bash
# Generate a config file
vantage init-config

# Edit it
$EDITOR ~/.config/vantage/config.toml

# Start the daemon
vantage daemon
```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

The config file lives at `~/.config/vantage/config.toml`. Generate one with:

```bash
vantage init-config
```

### Example Config

```toml
# Server settings
host = "127.0.0.1"
port = 8000

# Directories to serve (each appears in the sidebar)
[[repos]]
name = "notes"
path = "~/Documents/notes"

[[repos]]
name = "work-docs"
path = "~/work/documentation"

[[repos]]
name = "project"
path = "~/code/my-project"
```

Each repo is accessible at `http://localhost:8000/{name}/`.

### Configuration Reference

| Key            | Type             | Default       | Description                                 |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `host`         | string           | `"127.0.0.1"` | Server bind address                         |
| `port`         | integer          | `8000`        | Server port                                 |
| `repos[].name` | string           | _required_    | Display name and URL slug for the directory |
| `repos[].path` | string           | _required_    | Path to directory (supports `~`)            |
| `exclude_dirs` | array of strings | _(see below)_ | Directories to hide from file listings      |

### Excluded Directories

By default, Vantage hides common build/dependency directories from the sidebar, file picker, and recent files:

`node_modules`, `.venv`, `venv`, `__pycache__`, `.pytest_cache`, `.mypy_cache`, `.ruff_cache`, `.egg-info`, `.tox`, `.nox`, `dist`, `build`, `.cache`, `.git`, `.hg`, `.svn`

Override this in your config:

```toml
exclude_dirs = ["node_modules", ".venv", "vendor", "dist"]
```

---

## 🔧 Service Management (Linux)

Vantage can run as a systemd user service that starts automatically on login.

### Install the Service

```bash
vantage install-service
```

### Enable and Start

```bash
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable vantage
systemctl --user start vantage
```

### Common Commands

```bash
# Check status
systemctl --user status vantage

# View logs
journalctl --user -u vantage -f

# Restart after config changes
systemctl --user restart vantage

# Stop the service
systemctl --user stop vantage
```

### Keep Running After Logout

By default, user services stop when you log out. To keep Vantage running:

```bash
loginctl enable-linger $USER
```

---

## 🖥️ CLI Reference

```
vantage                          # Start server (alias for 'serve .')
vantage serve [PATH]             # Serve a single directory
vantage daemon                   # Serve multiple directories from config
vantage daemon -c /path/to.toml  # Use a custom config file
vantage init-config              # Generate example config file
vantage install-service          # Install systemd user service
vantage build PATH -o OUTPUT     # Build a static site
```

---

## 🐳 Docker

Run Vantage in Docker. Each directory gets its own isolated container with auto-assigned ports — view multiple documentation folders simultaneously.

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Build the image (one-time)
docker build -t vantage .

# 2. Install the CLI (symlink to your PATH)
ln -sf /path/to/vantage/vantage-docker /usr/local/bin/vantage-docker

# 3. View your docs
cd ~/my-docs
vantage-docker up
```

### Commands

```bash
vantage-docker up                     # Start viewer for current directory
vantage-docker up ~/projects/docs     # Start viewer for a specific path
vantage-docker up -p 9000             # Use a specific port (default: auto-assign)
vantage-docker up --build             # Rebuild the Docker image before starting
vantage-docker down                   # Stop viewer for current directory
vantage-docker down --all             # Stop all running viewers
vantage-docker status                 # List all running viewers with ports
vantage-docker logs                   # Tail container logs for current directory
```

Running `up` twice for the same directory is safe — it prints the existing URL.

### Multiple Viewers

Each directory gets its own container on its own port:

```bash
cd ~/notes        && vantage-docker up   # → http://localhost:54821
cd ~/work/specs   && vantage-docker up   # → http://localhost:61033
cd ~/project/docs && vantage-docker up   # → http://localhost:49217

vantage-docker status                    # see all three
vantage-docker down --all                # stop everything
```

### Docker Compose

Alternatively, use the included `docker-compose.yml` directly:

```bash
VANTAGE_DOCS=~/my-docs docker compose up -d
VANTAGE_DOCS=~/my-docs VANTAGE_PORT=9000 docker compose up -d
```

Files are mounted read-only into the container. Edits on the host are detected automatically and the browser refreshes via WebSocket — no manual reload needed.

## 🔌 API

Vantage exposes a REST API for programmatic access.

### Single-Repo Endpoints

| Endpoint                                    | Description             |

| `GET /api/files`                            | List all Markdown files |

### Multi-Repo Endpoints

In daemon mode, endpoints are prefixed with `/api/r/{repo}/`:

| Endpoint                                 | Description                  |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
